                Hey, Em, it's Paul<br>
                Uh, I was listening to the album<br>
                Good fucking luck, you're on your own<br>
                <br>
                <b>[Intro]</b><br>
                Guess who's back, back again?<br>
                Shady's back, tell a friend<br>
                Guess who's back? Guess who's back?<br>
                Guess who's back? Guess who's back?<br>
                Guess who's back? Guess who's back?<br>
                Guess who's back? (Haha)<br>
                Da-da-da, da, da, da, da, da, da<br>

                <br>
                <b>[Verse 1]</b><br>
                Well, look what the stork brung (What?)<br>
                Little baby devil with the forked tongue<br>
                And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb (Bleh)<br>
                With a forehead that it grew horns from (Look)<br>
                Still a white jerk (It's him), pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher<br>
                With the Vics, Percs and a Bud Light shirt<br>
                Lyrical technician (Yeah), an electrician (Yeah)<br>
                Y'all light work (Haha)<br>
                And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe (What?)<br>
                And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me (Why?)<br>
                If I was to ever take a leave (What?)<br>
                It would be aspirin' to break a feve' (Yeah)<br>
                If I was to ask for Megan Thee (What?)<br>
                Stallion if she would collab with me<br>
                Would I really have a shot at a feat? (Haha)<br>
                I don't know, but I'm glad to be back like<br>
                <br>
                <b>[Chorus]</b><br>
                Abra-abracadabra (And for my last trick)<br>
                I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (Like)<br>
                Abra-abracadabra (And for my last trick, poof)<br>
                Just like that and I'm back, bro<br>
                <br>
                <b>[Verse 2]</b><br>
                Now, back in the days of old me (When?)<br>
                Right around the time I became a dope fiend (Oh)<br>
                Ate some codeine as a way of coping (Mm)<br>
                Taste of opiates, case of O.E.<br>
                Turned me into smiley face emoji (Woo)<br>
                My shit may not be age-appropriate<br>
                But I will hit an eight-year-old in the face with a participation trophy<br>
                'Cause I have zero doubts<br>
                That this whole world's 'bout<br>
                To turn into some girl scouts<br>
                That censorship bureau's out to (Shut me down)<br>
                So when I started this verse<br>
                It did start off lighthearted at first (Hmm)<br>
                But it feels like I'm targeted<br>
                Mind-bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed<br>
                Look what I pocketed<br>
                Yeah, the shit is just like y'all had been light joggin', and<br>
                I've been runnin' at full speed<br>
                And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin', and<br>
                I'm the fight y'all get in<br>
                When you debate who the best, but opps, I'm white chalkin' when<br>
                I step up to that mic, cock it then<br>
                "Oh my God, it's him! Not again!"<br>
                <br>
                <b>[Chorus]</b><br>
                Abra-abracadabra (And for my last trick)<br>
                I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (Like)<br>
                Abra-abracadabra (And for my last trick, poof)<br>
                Just like that and I'm back, bro (Break it down)<br>
                <br>
                <b>[Bridge]</b><br>
                Sometimes, I wonder what the old me'd say (If what?)<br>
                If he could see the way shit is today (Look at this shit, man)<br>
                He'd probably say that everything is gay (Like happy)<br>
                What's my name? What's my name? (Slim Shady)<br>
                <br>
                <b>[Verse 3]</b><br>
                So how many little kids still wanna act like me? (Haha)<br>
                I'm a bigger prick than cacti be (Yeah)<br>
                And that's why these (What?)<br>
                Words sting just like you were being attacked by bees (Bzz)<br>
                In the coupe, leaning back my seat (What?)<br>
                Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group (Uh), the black guy (Guy) pees (Pees, haha)<br>
                In my Air Max 90s<br>
                White Ts, walkin' parental advisory<br>
                My transgender cat's Siamese (Why?)<br>
                Identifies as black, but acts Chinese (Haha)<br>
                Like a motherfuckin' Hacky Sack, I treat (What?)<br>
                The whole world 'cause I got it at my feet (Yeah)<br>
                How can I explain to you (What?)<br>
                That even myself I'm a danger to? (Yeah)<br>
                I hop on tracks like a kangaroo<br>
                And say a few things or two to anger you<br>
                But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit<br>
                Cancel me, what? Okay, that's it<br>
                Go ahead, Paul, quit, snake-ass prick<br>
                You male cross dresser (Haha), fake-ass bitch<br>
                And I'll probably get shit for that (Watch)<br>
                But you can all suck my dick, in fact<br>
                Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you<br>
                Fuck my own kids, they're brats (Fuck 'em)<br>
                They can screw off (Yeah), them and you all (Uh)<br>
                You too, Paul (Punk), got two balls<br>
                Big as RuPaul's (Woah)<br>
                What you thought you saw ain't what you saw (Nah)<br>
                'Cause you're never gon' see me<br>
                Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen<br>
                Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini<br>
                I vanish into the thin air as I'm leavin' like<br>
