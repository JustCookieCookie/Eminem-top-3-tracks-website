                    Look... If you had... one shot... or one opportunity...<br>
                    To seize everything you ever wanted... one moment...<br>
                    Would you capture it? Or just let it slip?<br>
                    Yo<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>[Verse 1]</b><br>
                    His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy<br>
                    There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti<br>
                    He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready<br>
                    to drops bombs, but he keeps on forgetting<br>
                    what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud<br>
                    He opens his mouth but the words won't come out<br>
                    He's chokin, how? Everybody's jokin now<br>
                    The clock's run out, time's up, over - BLAOW!<br>
                    Snap back to reality, OHH! there goes gravity<br>
                    OHH! there goes Rabbit, he choked<br>
                    He's so mad, but he won't<br>
                    Give up that easy nope, he won't have it<br>
                    He knows, his whole back's to these ropes<br>
                    It don't matter, he's dope<br>
                    He knows that, but he's broke<br>
                    He's so sad that he knows<br>
                    when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's<br>
                    back to the lab again, yo, this whole rap shift<br>
                    He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him<br>
                    <br>

                    You own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
                    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>

                    Soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping<br>
                    This world is mine for the taking<br>
                    Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order<br>
                    A normal life is boring; but superstardom's<br>
                    close to post-mortem, it only grows harder<br>
                    Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over<br>
                    These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows<br>
                    He's known as the Globetrotter<br>
                    Lonely roads, God only knows<br>
                    He's grown farther from home, he's no father<br>
                    He goes home and barely knows his own daughter<br>
                    But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water<br>
                    These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product<br>
                    They moved on to the next schmoe who flows<br>
                    He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera<br>
                    is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old partner<br>
                    But the beat goes on da-da-dum da-dum da-dah<br>

                    No more games, Imma change what you call rage<br>
                    Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged<br>
                    I was playin in the beginning, the mood all changed<br>
                    I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage<br>
                    But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher<br>
                    Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper<br>
                    All the pain inside amplified by the<br>
                    fact that I can't get by with my nine to<br>
                    five and I can't provide the right type of<br>
                    life for my family, cause man, these God damn<br>
                    food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie<br>
                    There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life<br>
                    And these times are so hard, and it's gettin even harder<br>
                    Tryin to feed and water my seed plus, teeter-totter<br>
                    Caught up between bein a father and a pre-madonna<br>
                    Baby momma drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna<br>
                    stay in one spot, another day of monotony<br>
                    has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got<br>
                    to formulate a plot, or end up in jail or shot<br>
                    Success is my only motherfuckin option, failure's not<br>
                    Mom I love you but this trailer's got to go<br>
                    I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot<br>
                    So here I go it's my shot, feet fail me not<br>
                    This may be the only opportunity that I got<br>
