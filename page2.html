                <b>[Intro]</b><br>
                Yeah<br>
                I know sometimes<br>
                Things may not always make sense to you right now<br>
                But hey<br>
                What Daddy always tell you?<br>
                Straighten up, little soldier<br>
                Stiffen up that upper lip<br>
                What you cryin' about?<br>
                You got me<br>
                <br>
                <b>[Verse 1]</b><br>
                Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad<br>
                When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had<br>
                I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh<br>
                I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry<br>
                'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers<br>
                No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares<br>
                We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it<br>
                Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it<br>
                We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls<br>
                When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls<br>
                Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you<br>
                Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news<br>
                I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems<br>
                The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me<br>
                All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see<br>
                Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did<br>
                We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me<br>
                But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'<br>
                Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers<br>
                But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason<br>
                I guess it was never meant to be<br>
                But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is<br>
                But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep<br>
                Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream<br>
                <br>
                <b>[Chorus]</b><br>
                Now hush, little baby, don't you cry<br>
                Everything's gonna be alright<br>
                Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya<br>
                Daddy's here to hold ya through the night<br>
                I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why<br>
                We feel how we feel inside<br>
                It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby<br>
                But I promise Mama's gon' be alright<br>
                <br>
                <b>[Verse 2]</b><br>
                Heh, it's funny<br>
                I remember back one year when Daddy had no money<br>
                Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree<br>
                And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em<br>
                I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying<br>
                'Cause Daddy felt like a bumâ€”see, Daddy had a job<br>
                But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom<br>
                And at the time, every house that we lived in<br>
                Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block<br>
                And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar<br>
                Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college<br>
                Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it<br>
                And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart<br>
                And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart<br>
                Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot<br>
                So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment<br>
                And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara<br>
                And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD<br>
                And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me<br>
                But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me<br>
                Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV<br>
                And Mama didn't like it<br>
                And you and Lainie were too young to understand it<br>
                Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit<br>
                And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it<br>
                I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand<br>
                'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud<br>
                Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'<br>
                Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out<br>
                To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now<br>
                Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here<br>
                Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here<br>
                I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?<br>
                Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment<br>
                <br>
                <b>[Chorus]</b><br>
                Now hush, little baby, don't you cry<br>
                Everything's gonna be alright<br>
                Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya<br>
                Daddy's here to hold ya through the night<br>
                I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why<br>
                We feel how we feel inside<br>
                It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby<br>
                But I promise Mama's gon' be alright<br>
                <br>
                <b>[Outro]</b><br>
                And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird<br>
                I'ma give you the world<br>
                I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you<br>
                I'll do anything for you to see you smile<br>
                And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine<br>
                I'ma break that birdie's neck<br>
                I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya<br>
                And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Haha)<br>
